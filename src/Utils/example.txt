# Configuration file for comparisons :
# Each line contain 4 elements :
# 1. The first file to compare (the oldest)
# 2. The second file to compare (the newest)
# 3. The kind of database used by the algorithm :
#   - "kcondisk" for an on disk database. Slow but with low memory usage
#   - "onmemory" for an on memory database. Faster but possibly high memory usage depending on the size of the files to compare.
#   - "multikcondisk" an on disk database splitted into several files instead of one big one.
#   - "rocksdb" to use rocksdb for ondisk database
# 4. The name of the comparison, used to name the results files.
